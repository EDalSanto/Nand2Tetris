# Operating System

### Overview
![TypicalOSServices](./images/TypicalOSServices.png)
* OS -> designed to close gaps between high level programming languages and the hardward on which they operate
  * i.e., accessing RAM, keyboard, screen, mathematical and string operations, etc.
  * effiency matters a lot for OS because all programs that run on top of it will be sluggish

### Efficiency Matters
* multiple two numbers using bit shifting and clever technique leads to log2N algorithm vs N algorithm for additive approach
* log2N much better than logN
  * each doubling of N only results in increase in 1 step for log2N algorithm
  * log2N -> depends on the number of digits of N

### Mathematical Operations
* implementation notes on Math Library for OS
  * algorithms for Mult, Div, and Sqrt make use of logN2 runtime algorithms

### Memory Access
